# Last Chingu Warrior

A fun and hellishly difficult game build by the awesome Geckos-Team-5 team using the newest version of the Phaser.js framework in only 8 weeks.

## Getting Started

Live version if the game can be found here: [Game]() <br>
If you want to look into the code, clone it or download the ZIP.

## Documentation

[Start here in case you need help with the code](https://github.com/chingu-voyage5/Geckos-Team-5/wiki/Start)

### Prerequisites

You should have the least amount of knowledge into node.js and have it installed on your computer.

### Installing

Navigate in you cmd line to your folder. Then you can run: `npm install` in your branch and `npm start` to start the application. This will activate a local webserver with webpack. Phaser.js doesn't work without a webserver, you can't just click on index.
